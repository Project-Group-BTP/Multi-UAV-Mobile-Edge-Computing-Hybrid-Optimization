# Multi-UAV Assisted Mobile Edge Computing: A Hybrid Optimization Approach

The primary objective of this research is to develop a framework for a multi-UAV-assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) network. We aim to jointly optimize four interdependent components: task offloading decisions, service caching placement, content caching strategies, and UAV trajectories. The goal is to minimize a weighted sum of service latency and system-wide energy consumption while simultaneously maximizing user fairness.
